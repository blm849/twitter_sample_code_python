# twitter_sample_code_python

This repo contains various Twitter sample code I have written in Python.

Initially I had written sample code in Perl before I knew Python. Going forward I expect to write an additional Twitter code in Python and save it in this repo.

The twitter code I wrote was retrieveTheirTweets.py. It will act as a command line twitter client for you. It will retrieve all the tweets
of the people you follow, wait so many seconds, and then retrieve the next set of tweets of people you follow. I used this program to experiment
with my ability to use the twitter API. I added some features like the ability to turn off RTs from people, as well as to show the "velocity" or 
rate of tweets I get.
